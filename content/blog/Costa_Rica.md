I stayed in a small beach town called Puerto Viejo, which was the perfect spot to relax and explore the area. The beaches were beautiful and the water was crystal clear. I spent my days snorkeling, kayaking, and exploring the nearby rainforest. I also had the chance to visit some of the local villages and learn about the culture and history of the area.

Overall, I had an incredible time in Costa Rica and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.
